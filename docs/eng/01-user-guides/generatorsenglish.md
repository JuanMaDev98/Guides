> ## Introduction
*In our game, generators play a crucial role in earning rewards. Below, we explain how the generator system works, how rewards are distributed, and how you can maximize your earnings.*

This is a **Free-to-Play** mode that rewards the community for their social interaction, daily activities, and inviting friends. The daily activity of your referred friends gives you additional bonuses, up to two levels of referrals, and having referrals is not mandatory nor does your performance depend on it.

> ## Concept and Objective
This game aims for the mass adoption of different communities and to reward the collective and individual efforts of gamers and influencers who seek to monetize their content, providing their communities with an incentive to support and get more actively involved. This reward is the $HCREDIT token, which can be accumulated and converted into $HCASH (our cryptocurrency) by playing the Tech Generators game. It pays a perfectly calculated distribution every 60 minutes for 10 consecutive years, becoming a monetization system for everyone, with no absurd requirements, and a perfect deflationary system, which we will explain further in this document. You just need to create your account in our app and start accumulating tokens.

> ## To get started:
First of all, just click **Check-in** once a day to earn $HCREDIT. Additionally, cooling generators for 45 minutes or 3 hours (180 min) will give you extra $HCREDIT. You can read our complete guide on how to farm $HCREDIT here: [HCREDIT Farming Guide](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/hcreditguide.md).

Earn enough $HCREDIT to buy generators from the in-game store. Availability varies based on demand, so try to get some quickly!

If you can’t earn enough $HCREDIT to buy a generator, you can spend your tokens hiring Engineers on a specific generator with available capacity.

Engineers expire after 24 hours. Don’t stop earning $HCREDIT to hire more Engineers and keep them working for you, generating passive hourly income.

If you own generators, your only job is to activate them by clicking the "Start All" button every hour. All generators will start working with just one click.

$HCREDIT is key to keeping the income flowing in this simple game mode.

Every 45 days, all player $HCREDIT balances will be burned to deflate the economy and keep it balanced. If you enter when the cycle is about to end, think about what strategy is best: should you wait for the reset or try to earn $HCASH? Don’t rush! There are other game modes where you can play for free while the $HCREDIT cycle resets.

And no, you keep all your generators; only the $HCREDIT balance resets. You even keep the Engineers hired on the reset day.

> ## Requirements and Compatibility
- **Web Requirements:** We suggest any modern web browser. **Example:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge...
Our game is compatible with almost all devices and browsers. It is built with the idea of allowing access without graphical, device, or connection restrictions.

- **Device Requirements:** Our game is compatible with almost any mobile device, personal computer, tablet, etc. You just need to be able to install the Telegram app to access the Mini-app or directly our **HUB-App** (coming soon). If that’s not possible, you can use a browser.

> ## Create Account
Currently, we don’t require the user to create an account. This is a dynamic process linked to your Telegram App account. If you already have a Telegram App account, just open our HUB-App. If it’s your first time, it will ask you to set the username you’ll use to identify yourself in the game. This username is your ID in the game and also your Wallet for in-game transfers. You can read the guide on the $HCREDIT token here: [Complete Guide](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/hcreditguide.md).

> ## App Overview
To learn more about our **HUB-App**, you can read it here: [HUB-App](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/HUBMiniappEng.md).

> ## Visual Overview of the Game
**NOTE:** All images and numbers are just representative for this documentation; real numbers will be available in the game.

If you're looking for a walkthrough of the game’s visual representation, the following image showcases the first view we’ve introduced in this **BETA** launch and the details it contains that you should understand.

> This is the full view of the game in its first stage: **Generator Ownership Assignment and Engineer Hiring** 
Later, we will introduce module upgrades, specializations, etc.

*Now let’s explain everything in detail:*
> ### 1- Generator Locations
The generators are located in each of these square spaces. You just need to tap one to see specific information about that generator.

> ### 2- Color Meaning
![genslots](../../../static/img/slotsupdated.png)
Generators have 4 activity states:
- **Green** means it's **available** and needs more engineers.
- **Blue** means you are the **owner** of that generator, and only you can see this color.
- **Red** means the generator is **off**, i.e., its owner hasn’t activated it or forgot to.
- **Blue with a red border** is your generator that’s off. You need to activate it for it to show as **Blue**.
- **White** means the generator is full of engineers and fully operational.
- No colors mean that those generators have no owners or haven’t been sold yet.

> ### 3- General Statistics
![genslots](../../../static/img/communitystats.png)

In this image, we see the general statistics, which are the sum of all participants in real-time, i.e., the contribution of all players represented by these numbers.

- The green icon is the total power of all generators and engineers combined. By observing these numbers, you can gauge the most active hours of the day.
- The blue square represents the number of payments made since the game launched (Reward Blocks).
- The generator icon represents the number of generators working in real-time.
- The tool icon represents the total number of active engineers among all generators in the game.
- "My Engineers" shows the total engineers you’ve hired across all generators where you contracted them. This number helps you monitor whether your participation increases or decreases.
- "Next Reward" shows the countdown to the next reward round. This timer displays the time between payments.

**NOTE:** The red button with an X at the top closes the game if tapped. To return to the game, go to the profile or catalog window in HUB-App and tap the game icon to open it. If you haven't yet read the guide to our app, you can [read it here](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/HUBMiniappEng.md).

> ### 4- Balance and Reset Cycle
![genslots](../../../static/img/balanceyreinicio.png)

- Here we show the balance of $HCASH (blue) and $HCREDIT (green) tokens.
- The red number inside the $HCREDIT balance bar indicates the time left until the individual token economy resets, creating a perfectly deflationary cycle and cleaning up server inactivity while balancing the statistics according to the active community's participation.
- The search bar is used to find a specific generator by entering the serial number. This is information you need from a friend or group where you collaborate based on common interests.

**NOTE:** You can find everything about the governance token economy $HCASH [here](../../../docs/eng/01-user-guides/whitepapereng.md) in the specific **Tokenomics** section.

> ### 5- Information Window
In this window, we see the information about a generator you own when tapping the blue square as we explained earlier. The data we need to understand in this **BETA** is:
- The button to turn the generator on. Tap it, and that’s it. You’ll see the "Off" red label change to "On" in green, meaning the service is active.

![genowner](../../../static/img/genowneron.png)

For generators you don’t own, this is the window that shows the option to hire engineers.
You just need to enter the number you want to hire based on your available $HCREDIT balance.
- For each Engineer, you pay **100 $HCREDIT**. Below, it shows **"You Pay"**, the amount you’ll need to pay

- For every 1 Engineer, you pay **100 $HCREDIT**. Below it shows **''You Pay''**, indicating the amount you need to pay, and click on the **Accept** button to assign them.
- Keep in mind that if someone else takes the available spot before you click accept, you'll need to find another available generator.

![engineercont](../../../static/img/engineerscontract.png)


> # Earning Tokens: First Steps
*To learn how to earn your first tokens, we recommend reading the* [HCREDIT: Complete Guide](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/hcreditguide.md) *to maximize your opportunities and time.*

- In addition to the strategies shown in this guide, you can earn more HCREDIT through daily on-chain tasks. These tasks are currently under development but will be available soon thanks to our partners who provide the option to sign transactions with gas covered by them.

- If any of these tasks lack gas coverage by our partners in the future, we guarantee that they will be ridiculously feasible and well-rewarded. Don’t overlook all the details and possibilities—plan your strategy well.

- More formats will be added to this documentation as we continue the development and integration of the game and contracts.

> # Learn How to Play
Playing is simple—you already have everything ready, and you've earned your first tokens. Now, I'll explain the game mechanics briefly, and you'll be ready to play.

### If you don’t own a generator:
- Go to the generator game
- Look for a green generator
- Tap it and assign as many engineers as possible, with a limit of 10 per generator.
- Click accept, and for 24 hours, you’ll be earning $HCASH tokens, which are paid every 60 minutes fractionally.

### If you own a generator:
- Go to your inventory
- Tap the generator and click activate
- Your generator is now in the generator game
- Go to your generator marked in blue
- Tap it and click the **''Power-On''** button to start it working.
- Every hour, you need to enter the game and click **''Power-On''** to keep it running. Otherwise, it shuts down, and neither you nor your fellow engineers hired for your generator will earn tokens.

> # All About Generators
Let’s dive into more details about the generators:

#### Buying Generators
- You can purchase generators in the store of our app (**HUB app**).
- The **Generator Boxes** in the store provide random generators when opened.
- There are 25 different generators, each with unique characteristics.
- Users can own up to 2 generators, but with the monthly [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass), they can own as many as they can acquire.

#### Generator Owners
- Generator owners cannot hire engineers for their own generators.
- Each generator has a base power that can be increased with the help of engineers.
- You can generate hourly income without engineers; the earnings are divided 35/65. If no engineers are present, the 65% goes back to the game treasury. We recommend finding partners in the community to support you or joining Guilds.
- Generators are limited, so be sure to acquire them soon. Availability depends on the average number of active daily players.
- The store operates automatically, meaning sold-out items like generators can become available at any time. We recommend frequently checking the store if you plan to buy one firsthand, although you can buy on the secondary market, soon available in the HUB app.
- Generator owners must keep them powered on to generate earnings for themselves and the engineers hired for that generator.
- If the generator is off, no income is generated.
- Generators can be upgraded with modules.
- **Base Power**: Each generator has a base power contributing to the total reward.
- **Additional Power**: The generator’s power increases with the assignment of engineers. The more engineers, the higher the power.
- Generator owners can share their generator number so friends can find it and support each other.
- The generator owner can delegate the task of powering it on every hour to a specific user if they have a [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass).

#### Engineers
- Engineers are purchased with $HCREDIT and remain assigned to a generator for 24 hours.
- The 24-hour countdown is individual for each unit (**unit = 1 engineer**), meaning they don’t all leave at once but in the same order they were hired as the 24 hours pass.
- You can assign engineers to generators to increase their power and your rewards.
- You can assign up to 10 engineers per generator without a limit on the number of generators, meaning you can assign 10 engineers to as many generators as your $HCREDIT balance allows.
- If you have the monthly [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass), you can assign up to 20 engineers per generator.
- Assigned engineers cannot be removed.
- If you assign engineers to a powered-on generator and the owner doesn’t power it on every 60 minutes, that downtime won’t generate income. Be sure to use generators owned by reliable players.
- You can find friends or partners in the community who own generators and are reliable and active to maximize your chances.
- The power provided by 1 engineer is 10 Khash.

#### Consumables
- These are items obtained through gameplay, by completing daily tasks, checking in, and some are purchasable in the game store.
- They are transferable, marketable, and obviously, usable.
- These items, as their name suggests, will be consumed upon use and will provide a bonus or effect that will depend on the specific item.

#### Rewards
- **Total Reward**: The total hourly reward is 353 $HCASH Tokens. This is distributed among generators based on their participation in the combined total power.
- ##### **Reward Distribution**:
  - **Generator Owner**: Receives a fixed portion of 35% of the total reward. If they have a [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass), they get a 15% additional bonus on the amount collected in that round.
  - **Engineers**: Engineers earn a fixed 65% of the distribution per round among participating engineers, and if the user has a [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass), they get an additional 5% of the amount generated in each round. Additionally, depending on the generator to which you assign engineers, you can earn between 1% and 5% per round. If you have engineers assigned to different generators, the reward calculations are individual for each generator.

## Tips to Maximize Engineer Earnings

1. **Diversify Your Engineers**: Assign engineers to various generators to maximize your rewards. While some generators may fail or slow down, others will perform well, balancing your chances rather than risking everything on one generator.
2. **Monitor Base Power**: Consider the base power of generators when assigning engineers. Generators with higher base power may offer larger global rewards, though it may be harder to get those spots due to competition. Generators with lower base power offer more capacity—if you have limited time or poor connection speed, this is a great option, although a high-capacity generator maxed out with engineers can become powerful.
3. **Take Advantage of Bonuses**: Use the progressive bonus from generators with lower base power to earn more rewards per engineer. Many low-base power generators have better bonuses, and with many engineers and a [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass), you could secure good participation.
4. **Consistency**: Be consistent with tasks that generate $HCREDIT. Don’t settle for just assigning a few engineers—remember, after 24 hours, you’ll need to hire new engineers to keep earning income.
5. **Community**: Find loyal partners or join **Guilds** where you can find both generators and engineers from active friends.
6. **Follow the News**: We plan to launch updates soon with more options and experiences in the game’s development, adding new features and choices. Follow our announcement channels in our official groups, subscribe to our emails, or stay informed through your Guild to react quickly to upcoming opportunities.

> ## Economic Impact and Balance
The number of Generators and the capacity to hire Engineers will never exceed the number of active participating users. This ensures the system remains balanced and fair for everyone.

The algorithm automatically adjusts and balances the store's availability by calculating active users. If active users increase, the store will release new generators for sale. This can happen at any time to ensure fairness. We recommend visiting the store occasionally.

The individual economic reset cycle of this game ensures there are never excess tokens and cleans the system of inactive players, abandoned multi-accounts, bots, etc., adjusting statistics to the active community and distributing profits as fairly as possible.

Everything works automatically without manual intervention by the development team.

> ## Benefits of **TechPass**
#### Description
- The **TechPass** is NOT required to play— all players have access to the same features for free, with the difference being a greater reach or participation if you’re a subscribed monthly user.
- This pass lasts 30 days to avoid unnecessary commitment to paying for something expensive over a long time, unlike other games or projects.
- This pass focuses on accessibility for all users who want to get more involved than others.
- It's ridiculously affordable and accessible to everyone.
- Its 30-day duration and low price give everyone a chance to try its benefits and decide if it’s worth it, compared to other games with high costs that are not affordable for everyone.
- The price is $2, represented in the payment coins we will be adding and eventually in $HCASH after the TGE.

#### Advantages
- Players can own as many generators as they can acquire on their account, while the free maximum is 2.
- You can assign twice as many engineers as an unsubscribed user.
- You receive a notification 10 minutes before the store releases more generators.
- You receive a notification 5 minutes before your generator shuts down.
- The interval to reactivate your generators changes to 2 hours instead of the established period of 1 hour.
- You can delegate a user to help you keep your generator running.
- Generator owners receive an additional 15% on hourly earnings.
- Engineers you hire charge 5% more per individual payment (+5% per engineer’s payment).
- Generator owners with [TechPass](#benefits-of-techpass) have more general visibility (Coming Soon).
- $HCREDIT generated is x2. [HCREDIT Guide here](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/hcreditguide.md)
- If you are a content creator, you will have access to a special panel to control your stats. Learn more in the **Content Creators Guide**. You don’t need to be a super influencer to start as a content creator. With our tools, you can start even with 10 followers.

> # Tokenomics
Read everything about the overall project economy in the - [Tokenomics](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/whitepapereng.md/#tokenomics) document of the Space Hunters Whitepaper guide, our other game that serves as the seed for the general economic operation.

> ## Conclusion
Our system is designed to encourage the strategic allocation of engineers and active participation in the game (DAU).

Free-to-Play, strategies with $HCREDIT, and a residual economy implementation to create mass adoption with no excuses to start playing.

Explore all options to maximize your rewards and enjoy the game to the fullest!
