## About HCREDIT
![hcreditpngbanner](../../../static/img/hcreditpngbanner.png)
**$HCREDIT** is an off-chain reward token based on the **mass adoption model**. It can only be obtained through **social events**, tasks, or **partnership activities**. Think of it as our **monetization model**, where players can monetize their social networks, gaming channels, content creation and more with no limitations or ridiculous requirements.  This token is not tradable on any exchange and can only be used within the Hunter ecosystem. 

This is an innovative reward system which convert your participation into a valuable tool to generate you revenues. We continue innovating and adding more use cases and ways to interact with the token and ecosystem, the following list are the current plans and the ones coming very soon:

## Claim Process

$HCREDIT is directly sent to the **game wallet**. If a user does **not provide a game wallet** or if the provided wallet address is **inaccurate**, the reward will **not be distributed** and will automatically be **burned**. There is always a **timeline** for this process, along with an **announcement** detailing the steps to follow.

## Wallet & Username
**UPDATE:** Your game username is your wallet address in our ecosystem for $HCASH and $HCREDIT tokens, you can add your username right now using the command /username like this : **/username yankieldbc**. After TGE this details will be updated if required for deposits from external wallets.

> You have 2 **free tries**, if you want to make another change you can do so after 24h but this option only available to [TechPass](/docs/eng/01-user-guides/generatorsenglish.md/#benefits-of-techpass) members.


## Utility

The main utility is monetize your social support, content creation and effort over many social networks. We have many plans for $HCREDIT & the current ones under development include:

- **Special Rewards**: Exclusive items for active players.
- **Unique Rewards**: Rare or limited-time items.
- **Limited Time Rewards**: Obtain items only during special events.
- **Discount Coupon**: Use $HCREDIT to get discounts on in-game items.
- **Airdrop Shares**: Receive additional tokens during airdrops.
- **Tech: Generators**: Buy Generators, contract Engineers,upgrade your technology and engineers ability.

*These are just  a few examples of the many uses we have planned for $HCREDIT. We will continue to innovate, do not limit  yourself to the current uses.*


## Supply, Distribution, and Burning
$HCREDIT is build  on the **mass adoption model** with a **perfect deflationary system**:

- **Total Supply**: Unlimited
- **Supply Allocation**: 100% Community Rewards
- **Burning Mechanism**: 
  - Each token spent is **burned**. 
  - **Unclaimed tokens** (after 15 days) are burned.
  - $HCREDIT is **not a holding token**; after a **45-day period**, all tokens are burned, resetting the $HCREDIT economy **every 45 days**.

When $HCREDIT is distributed via **airdrop or system activities**, and a member has **no game account** at the time of distribution, the tokens are **burned** and cannot be reclaimed or refunded. We always announce **timelines**, so it is the member's **responsibility** to stay informed or ask for help before the end date.

If $HCREDIT is earned through **normal player-system interaction**, it is automatically **credited**.

## **Reward Distribution:** 
Each event or activity will have a **max cap**, **reward pool**, or **reward per points**. The allocation for pools and max caps will be based on the **leaderboard** and distribution for social participation is based on Mass Adoption concept with no earning limits.

## $HCREDIT Flow
This is a simple design which explain in short the flow concept:
