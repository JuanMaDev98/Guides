## <span style="color:#FF3D3D">Core Economic Features of Space Hunters
<span style="color:#00FFFF">*Supply Control & Token Burning*</span>

One of the pillars of the economy is a<span style="color:#00FFFF"> burn mechanism</span> designed to ensure that both $HCREDIT and $HCASH maintain their value over time. Each time a player uses $HCREDIT (to craft, buy, or upgrade), a portion of it is burned, meaning that the total supply of the token decreases gradually. This is crucial in preventing inflation and maintaining a balanced economy.

Additionally, periodic large-scale burns ensure that any excess circulating tokens are removed from the system. For example, every 45 days,all circulating $HCREDIT is automatically burned, creating a deflationary pressure that increases token value, not in price since isnt a priced token but in value as a currency for the game and the community.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">**Community-Driven Economy**</span>
The economy of Space Hunters is designed to thrive through community participation. Playersâ€™ contributions to their guilds, guild wars, the marketplace, and governance votes directly impact how the economy evolves. Community members who hold $HCASH have the power to propose or vote on changes to the tokenomics, ensuring that the game remains a collaborative experience with transparency at every level.


<span style="color:#00FFFF">The Space Hunters ecosystem</span> offers free benefits for communities by rewarding interaction and engagement through our $HCREDIT token. Designed for mass adoption, $HCREDIT's purpose is to unite web3 communities, rewarding active members while creating a shared experience. As players interact and engage within their own groups, they also connect with others, building a circle of interconnected communities that all converge in the Space Hunters universe. Communities can promote themselves through our platform, leveraging new features we're developing. After our release, this ecosystem will create a hub for collaboration, growth, and shared success

See you soon hunters!
