### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">Crafting Strategies**
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Burning Resources for Power**: Crafting is one of the primary methods to burn excess resources, preventing inflation and making your remaining assets more valuable. Focus on crafting high-demand robots for powerful stats and competitive advantage.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Balancing Resources and Supply**: While resources may seem plentiful at first, the supply of crafted items is often limited. Time your crafting wisely to avoid wasting valuable materials.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Limited-Time Items**: Keep an eye out for crafting recipes that are available for a limited time or have a cap on their supply. Crafting these items early can give you an edge over other players.

### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">Crafting Recipes: Robot Troops**
The recipes for various **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Robot Troops** offer unique benefits in terms of **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Influence**, **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Training**, **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Luck**, and supply limitations.

### **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Tips for Crafting Success**
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Start Small, Build Up**: Focus on crafting lower-tier robots like **ScrapBot** and **HelioBot** to gather resources efficiently. Once you've built a strong base, start crafting more advanced bots like **XenorBot** and **AetherBot**.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Prioritize Rare Resources**: As you progress, rare resources like **Aetherium** and **Phasium** will become crucial. Collect these resources through **Excavation** mode or by trading on the marketplace.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Influence and Training Balance**: Higher-tier bots provide significant boosts to your **Influence** and **Training** stats. Prioritize these bots if you're looking to dominate missions and earn greater rewards.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Optimize Crafting for Luck**: Some robots like **RadiantBot** and **XenorBot** offer substantial **Luck** boosts. Use these bots strategically to increase your chances of finding rare items in missions and excavations.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Limited Supply Bots**: Bots like **AetherBot** and **PhasiumBot** have highly limited supplies, making them extremely valuable. Aim to craft these as soon as possible to secure their benefits before they run out.
