### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">Usage of Resources**
These resources are versatile and can be used in various ways:
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Crafting**: Use resources to create items, weapons, upgrade equipment and more.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Building**: Construct or improve structures to aid your gameplay.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Repair**: Fix damaged equipment or machinery.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Selling**: Sell directly in the marketplace to maximize earnings or to NPCs for game $HCASH tokens, also you can buy/sell for profit if you understand the Real-Time market flow.

---

### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">How It Works**
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Energy Cost**: Each excavation attempt consumes **15 energy points**. Players must manage their energy carefully to maximize excavation attempts.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Drop Chance**: Resource drop chances depend on the tools and avatars being used. Using better tools or avatars with high **luck** increases the likelihood of rare drops.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Special Items**: Occasionally, special items unique to the **Excavation Mode** are uncovered. These items cannot be found in any other game modes, making them highly valuable. High quality tools can be found only in this game mode.

### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">Tools and Avatars**

#### **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Tools**
Tools used during excavation play a crucial role in determining success:
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Cooldown**: The time required before the tool can be used again. Shorter cooldowns mean faster and more frequent excavations.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Base Luck**: This stat directly affects the drop chances for rare resources. The higher the luck, the more likely you are to find valuable items.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">PoE (Proof of Efficiency)**: This metric measures the efficiency of your extraction process, ensuring you gather resources in the most optimized way possible, and helps the algorithm to measure your performance and the constantly variation of the game difficulty.

#### **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Avatars**
Avatars complement the tools by providing **multipliers** that boost specific stats:
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Cooldown Multipliers**: Reduce tool cooldowns, allowing you to excavate more frequently.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Luck Multipliers**: Increase the chance of finding rare and valuable resources.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">PoE Multipliers**: Enhance your tool's PoE, making each excavation attempt more productive.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Base Influence and Training Points**: These primarily affect **missions** and is an additional statistic that increases the item utility.

### **<span style="color:#FF3D3D">Gameplay Tips & Strategies**
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Optimize Your Loadout**: Choose tools and avatars that complement each other. For instance, if you're aiming to farm rare resources, focus on avatars that boost **Luck** and tools with high **Base Luck** stats.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Manage Energy Efficiently**: Always keep an eye on your energy bar. Use **Energy Batteries** or wait for regeneration to ensure you have enough energy for important excavation attempts.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Diversify Resource Collection**: Donâ€™t focus solely on one resource; collecting a variety of materials can help you in different aspects of gameplay such as crafting, selling, or repairing.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Balance Cooldown and Yield**: Use tools with a balanced cooldown time and resource yield. High-PoE tools may have longer cooldowns, so plan your excavation schedule accordingly.
- **<span style="color:#00FFFF">Store Special Items**: Special items found in this game mode can be crucial later in the game, so store them wisely and use them strategically.

By mastering the excavation game mode, you can accumulate rare resources, craft powerful items, and get an edge over other players in the Space Hunters universe. Happy hunting!
