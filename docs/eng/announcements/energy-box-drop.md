# ðŸŽ–Dear Licensed Space Hunters!ðŸŽ–

We're excited to announce our upcoming drop featuring a special box that allows you to extend your gameplay time. There will only be 250 NFTs available for claim.

## Requirements:

- You must refer at least 2 friends by September 15th to be eligible.
- Add our brand name, SpaceHunters, to your Telegram username to earn additional $HCREDITS. (Read about this [here](#))

We also have 24 extra NFT boxes reserved for our ambassadors, which will be used for community giveaways and a few secured whitelists.

### What is a secured whitelist?

- Even if you don't meet the criteria, you can still participate.

## Key Dates:

- The drop will take place between September 16th and 30th. If all NFTs are claimed before the end date, the drop will close automatically.
- The snapshot will be taken on September 15th at 15:00 UTC.

## Item Details:

This box can store one powerful energy battery, allowing you to fully refill your energy points once. If you find a battery and the box is empty, it will be automatically stored. If the box is full, the battery will automatically be used to refill your energy points. You can own as many boxes as you want; the more boxes you have, the more energy you can store, enabling longer continuous gameplay.

Stay tuned! More details about this box will be posted tomorrow in our game guide and whitepaper under the items section.

**Enjoy!**
