## ðŸš€Best Practices for Code Review


A study of a Cisco Systems programming team revealed that a review of 200â€“400 LOC over 60 to 90 minutes should yield 70â€“90% defect discovery.
So, if a pull request has big diffs, it can be problematic.
In addition, large pull requests will take more time and will probably block other developers who may be depending on the code.

### Conflict resolution
Eventually, the pull request author and the reviewer will disagree. That is perfectly fine and actually a sign of good team dynamics. However, what is not fine is having endless discussions about it or one developer overriding the other because of reasons like personal opinions, seniority, access rights, etc.

Itâ€™s better to prevent these situations from happening and have a conflict resolution strategy.
One particular method that works well is to always require at least two code reviewers.
In those cases, itâ€™s simply the majority vote that counts.
